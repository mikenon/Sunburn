Sunburn
=======
A plugin for Bukkit and Spout
-----------------------------
*Sunburn is a work in progress*

Encourage players to build downwards and inwards, instead of outward and upwards. With the threat of combustion. Sunburn measures players' exposure to sunlight, igniting the player at a configurable level. A gui element is added to the right of every player's hotbar, displaying the player's current exposure level. Sunburn also adds an item to the game, Lotion, that enables players to withstand full exposure without bursting into flames. Lotion adds a gui element on top of the sun meter, allowing the player to accurately gauge the time remaining.
